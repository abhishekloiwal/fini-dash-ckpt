This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Zincwork tagging workflow

- The dashboard reads ticket tags from the committed CSV exports (see `Support_tickets_*` files). To refresh data for clients, run the local tagging script, review the CSV diff, and push to GitHub; Netlify will redeploy with the new snapshot.
- Tagging actions are **disabled by default** in production builds. To re-enable the “Run tagging” button while working locally, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TAGGING=true` in `.env.local` before running `npm run dev`.
- Even when the UI button is hidden, you can still call the tagging APIs locally if the env flag is enabled.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
