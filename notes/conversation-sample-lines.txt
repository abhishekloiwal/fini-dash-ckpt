[2025-09-25] (esc) [Connection Issue] Monarch Money - Pilgrim Bank (TX) Hi Monarch Money, I am reaching out on behalf of Pilgrim Bank, who recently underwent a recent digital banking conversion from their old platform (Shazam) to their new digital banking platform (Apiture) on Monday. It looks like one of your mutual customers is attempting to log in, but running into an issue with the connection. Can you please update their login to:https://banking.apiture.com/DigitalBanking/fx?iid=PBPTX2. This can be accessed from their Main Homepagehttps://pilgrimbank.bank and clicking“Log In” at the top of the page as well for validation. I’ve also cc’ed Pilgrim Bank’s main point of contact on this launch project, Michelle Tidwell. Please feel free to reach out with any questions you might have.

[2025-09-25] (std) [Connection Issue] New institution report for: Vanguard User's chosen option: Account data is delayed or not updating Additional notes: The holdings of my taxable vanguard account aren't updating correctly. It's been a few weeks showing my cash holdings are lower than they actually are.
[2025-09-24] (std) [Investments] After digging further I believe I found the issue, which isn't covered in this. In the investments tab that shows a breakout, there is one specific Target Index Fund, SWYJX that doesn't appear to be pulling the correct share price, leading it to be underreporting there. Is that something I can somehow modify or is this specific to certain kinds of investment vehicles?

[2025-09-25] (esc) [Transactions] Hi Justin, Thanks for the update. I’m glad to hear a fix was deployed. Unfortunately, my transactions are still showing the incorrect categories/labels from when the bug occurred. Since this affected hundreds (if not thousands) of transactions, it’s not feasible for me to manually correct them. Can your team roll back the changes that were applied by the bug, or bulk reapply the correct categories? That’s the only way this issue can really be resolved on my end. Appreciate your help, Mitchell

[2025-09-25] (esc) [Transactions] Problems with Capital One Transaction Import Good afternoon, We have a Capital One credit card that is linked to Monarch. There are several authorized users for this card, each with their own account number. The problem is that all of the transactions get imported as one account, without indicating which user made the purchase. Is there any way to make it so the transactions are automatically segregated/tagged between users? Capital One suggests to create a separate login for each user to sync with Monarch, but that will create duplicate transactions with the main account. Please advise, thank you!

[2025-09-16] (esc) [Connection Issue] Hello, Apologies for the delayed reply on this. The issue is that the balance is not updating. It’s for a Fidelity brokerage account ending in 6496. I have a bi-weekly auto deposit so this account should be increasing regularly and should be ~$900 now, but you can see the balance has flatlined. I have another Fidelity 529 account that is updating perfectly so I think it’s an issue just with the specific brokerage account. I’ve already walked through the other troubleshooting steps, tried refreshing all accounts, disconnected and reconnected the account, but still the same issue remains. Please let me know how to proceed, and hopefully you can help to resolve this. Thank you for the help. Best, Mischa
[2025-09-10] (std) [Transactions] Thank you. Which date did this change happen on? And where can this data for both transaction date and posted date be found? Or did the team just make the change irreversibly with no notice?
[2025-09-15] (esc) [Connection Issue] The balances are once again out of sync.

[2025-09-16] (std) [Connection Issue] Hello, The financial institutions that use MX, when given the option to login via the institution, do nothing. There are also a variety of links that do not seem regulated. The institutions that use direct sign in to banks are great. It would be nice to have more customizable graphics, such as a cash flow visualization like the desktop, or just different variations of presenting the same data. The key for me is being able to see all of my accounts and unfortunately the variation of quality in account connection prevents that.

All of the information is correct, the issue is I keep getting a message saying that Data Syncing is Paused and I have to reconnect the accounts about every other day and then everything is good How do I avoid having to resync my account every other day? I never had to do that with the old card (8948)
[2025-08-28] (std) [Connection Issue, fini-other] Hi Thank you, its working now. Beverly Yang (646) 647-0074 beverlyryang@gmail.com
[2025-09-01] (std) [Transactions] Perfect workaround, I added the rule it and it’s been working great! Thank you very much ☺️
[2025-08-30] (esc) [Connection Issue] Cant connect with Plaid. 2FA never worked with plaid in the past and Fincity was better that way,
[2025-08-17] (esc) [Connection Issue] Hello, I've tried to create duplicate accounts but that hasn't worked. Now both accounts won't update regardless of MFA attempts. Perhaps MX is linking to the wrong site? The Capital Group site that we log into is this one: https://retirement.financialtrans.com/cg/login. When I log in through the website, I'm only prompted for a username and password, no further steps are needed. Can Plaid be requested to gain access to this site? Both Finicity and MX have had problems with the connection.

[2025-09-02] (std) [Transactions] Hi, I have a LOT of split transactions, and if I’m going to have to manipulate the input CSV file before I can bring it into the app, that is likely more work than I’m willing to do right now to move applications. Is there any chance you would have this feature in the future? Thanks, Troy
[2025-08-30] (std) [Transactions, Connection Issue] ok thanks I will try this Anna Schneiderman
[2025-08-28] (esc) [Connect with Team] Thanks for the update, Simon!

For now, vemno is working again. **_Have a great and happy day! ~ Arielle _** ƸӜƷ (\ )) )\\ (( / .( \\.-"```"'` =_/= > , / \ )__.\ | > / / ||\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ `" `" `" `"
[2025-08-30] (std) [Transactions, Settings, Connection Issue] Thank you. I'm not sure how that happened. Perhaps I duplicated the connection when I added my AmEx. I was able to delete the duplicate connection and I'm back on track. Thanks for your help. Cameron Christensen, CEFP, CRL camrchristensen@gmail.com (347) 971-1235 LinkedIn

[2025-09-02] (std) [fini-other, Connection Issue] Seems to have worked great, thank you!
[2025-09-03] (esc) [Connect with Team] I have had to reset up all of my accounts and reorganize all my transactions. I’m not satisfied with monarch because this is the second or third time I’ve had to do that. I lose the ability to see historical data on my accounts when I do this. Is there anything you can do? Very Respectfully, Devin DePalmer
[2025-08-31] (std) [Connection Issue] Yes I can login into the site. https://www.ezcardinfo.com/ I just tried logging in on my computer instead of my phone and it still didn't work. I put my user name and password in and I received the error attached below before getting a MFA code. Thanks, Jacob

[2025-09-03] (esc) [Connection Issue] That still didn't work. I am going to try to upload the transactions during that time period manually, via csv. Regards, Manish (917) 603-0926
[2025-09-01] (esc) [Connection Issue, Transactions] Thank you! I connected with Finicity and it worked great. Thank you for your assistance! You can close the ticket. Best, Robin

[2025-09-02] (std) [Investments] Great, it looks like my Coinbase data is accurate! Thanks for the quick turnaround on a fix. ​ >
[2025-09-02] (esc) [Billing] I renewed my membership. Can you just confirm that the 30$ credit was added to my account?
[2025-09-02] (std) [Connect with Team] It is fixed! Thanks! Sent from Gmail Mobile
[2025-08-22] (std) [Connect with Team] Thanks! Working now!
[2025-08-15] (std) [Transactions, Budget] Hi Simon, Thanks for the detailed response. Appreciate these ideas and potential solutions. Neither of these quite work because my situation is that it's a "company car" that I pay for via a deduction from my monthly paycheck. So it's not a loan (thus there's no loan amount to payback) and it's not a lease (I don't withdraw from an account to make a payment). It's essentially a different form of payroll deduction. I want to track that amount so I know how much I'm paying for my monthly automobile expenses. Does Monarch provide a means for tracking other forms of payroll deductions, such as when people cover part of their health insurance plan via payroll contributions? Perhaps that sort of setup would work well here. Thanks for your help! John
