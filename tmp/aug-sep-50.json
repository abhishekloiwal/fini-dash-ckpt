You’ve pinpointed that the SWYJX Target Index Fund isn’t pulling the correct share price, leading to underreporting in your investment breakout. While Monarch pulls prices automatically for synced accounts, if the data provider isn’t supplying the correct price, you can manually add or edit holdings to reflect accurate values.\n\nHere’s what you can do:\n- You can add a manual holding to your investment account with the correct share price and quantity. This allows you to track the balance based on the latest market price you enter.\n- To do this, go to the account details page, select “Add holding,” and input the correct details for SWYJX. If you’re on mobile, tap the “...” on the top right of the investment account page and select “Add holding.”\n- If you want to track the balance manually without specifying holdings, you can set up a fully manual investment account and update the balance as needed.\n\nThis approach works for any investment vehicle where the automatic price feed isn’t accurate.

It sounds like your Scotiabank account is having trouble syncing due to a Plaid error with two-step verification, while your other accounts are updating normally.

You can do this by going to your Institutions page, clicking \"Add an account,\" and searching for Scotiabank. If alternate data providers are available, you'll see clickable icons next to the institution name.\n- Double-check your Scotiabank online banking settings to make sure third-party access and multi-factor authentication preferences allow connections to Monarch Money.\n- If you continue to experience issues, you can manually import transactions via CSV to keep your account up to date.\n\nLet me know if you need more detailed instructions or if you run into any other errors.\n\nPlease let me know if you need anything else. \n\n Warm Regards, \n Mariposa","categories":["Connection Issue"],"escalation":false,"reasoning":"The user is reporting a connection issue with their Scotiabank account, specifically that account data is delayed or not updating.

It sounds like your credit card transactions are syncing correctly, but your bank account transactions (like ACH and direct deposits) aren't appearing automatically. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this:\n\n- Allow 24-48 hours for new transactions to show up, as some banks only send transactions once they've posted.\n- Check if the missing transactions have posted to your bank account—pending transactions may not sync until they're finalized.\n- Update your login settings by going to your [Institutions settings page](https://app.monarchmoney.com/settings/institutions), clicking the three dots next to your account, and selecting \"Update login settings.\" This can refresh your connection and pull in recent transactions.\n- If transactions still aren't syncing, try adding your bank through a different data provider using the \"Add Account\" flow. This can sometimes pull a more complete list of transactions. Learn more about [choosing your data provider](https://help.monarchmoney.com/hc/en-us/articles/14973178437780-Choosing-Your-Data-Provider).\n- As a last resort, you can manually import transactions by uploading a CSV file.

This makes my net worth look crazy.","answer":"Hi Trevor,\n\nThanks for reaching out. It sounds like your Lakeview Loan account balance is fluctuating between a small amount and your actual loan total, which is causing your net worth to look inaccurate. This can happen if the account sync isn't pulling consistent data or if the account type is set incorrectly, sometimes interpreting liabilities as assets.\n\nHere's what you can do to fix this:\n- On Monarch web, go to your Accounts page and select your Lakeview Loan account.\n- Click \"Edit\" in the top right, then choose \"Edit balance history.\" Here, you can manually correct any incorrect balances for specific dates.\n- If you need to fix historical data, you can upload a CSV file with the correct balance history by clicking \"Upload balance history\" in the account details.\n- Make sure the account type is set as a liability, and if the balance seems inverted, follow these steps: [Fixing Inverted Balances](https://help.monarchmoney.com/hc/en-us/articles/18201662700948-Fixing-Inverted-Balances).\n\nIf you continue to see erratic balance changes, try refreshing your account or updating your login settings in your [account settings](https://app.monarchmoney.com/settings/institutions).\n\nPlease let me know if you need anything else. \n\nWarm Regards, \nMariposa","categories":["Connection Issue"],"escalation":false,"reasoning":"The user is reporting that their Lakeview Loan Subserviced by Mr. Cooper account balance is fluctuating dramatically between ~$70 and $453k+, which is impacting their net worth calculation.

When you open a new account at an institution that's already linked to Monarch, you'll usually need to update your login credentials for that connection so Monarch can detect and sync the new account. Here's what you can do:\n\n1. Go to your [Institutions settings](https://app.monarchmoney.com/settings/institutions) page.\n2. Find Chase in your list and click the three dots to the right of the name.\n3. Select \"Update login settings\" and follow the prompts. This refreshes your connection and should pull in any newly opened accounts.\n\nIf your new Chase credit card still doesn't show up after updating, you can try adding Chase again using a different data provider:\n- [Plaid](https://app.monarchmoney.com/accounts/add-account/plaid/ins_56)\n- [Finicity](https://app.monarchmoney.com/accounts/add-account/finicity/102224)\n- [MX](https://app.monarchmoney.com/accounts/add-account/mx/chase)\n\nLet me know if this helps or if you run into any trouble. \n\nPlease let me know if you need anything else. \n\nWarm Regards, \nMariposa","categories":["Connection Issue"],"escalation":false,"reasoning":"The user has reported that a newly opened Chase credit card is not appearing in their Monarch Money account. According to the provided knowledge, when a new account is opened at an already linked institution, the recommended solution is to update the login credentials for the connection within Monarch. This prompts Monarch to recognize and sync the new account. If updating credentials does not resolve the issue, users can also try connecting through alternate data providers (Plaid, Finicity, MX) to see if the new account appears. These steps are directly relevant to the user's situation and do not require escalation, as they are standard troubleshooting procedures for missing accounts at a connected institution.","feedbackType":null,"expectingUserFollowup":false,"createdAt":1758342768675,"basedOn":[{"id":"dd873e76dff3d0add5e354511f623187","title":"All of my Chase credit cards sync fine except for my Amazon Visa (ending in 6038) - it added fine but hasn't updated in a month!

Currently, due to federal regulations, Monarch Money and other third-party platforms are unable to sync federal student loan accounts like Mohela.

(It's actually Mr. Cooper, but is subserviced by Lakeview Loan.) The value it should show is -$428,505.78. That is what is shown when I go directly to our Lakeview account. In Monarch, it is jumping back and forth between that value and $0. It seems to be bouncing back and forth between those values on a daily basis. It won't show that in the account, as I manually fixed a few of them in the account history. But I will stop doing so at this point to assist in the troubleshooting process.\n\n\n\nIs that all the information that you need?\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\nJason A.

The balance jumping between -$428,505.78 and $0 is definitely not expected.\n\nThis type of discrepancy can happen if Monarch receives inconsistent data from your bank, especially for loan accounts. Since you've already manually edited the history, it's helpful that you'll pause those changes for now so we can observe the sync pattern directly.\n\nIf you haven't already, you can try the following steps:\n- Use the \"Refresh all\" option on your Accounts page to force a sync.\n- Double-check your account settings to ensure the account is set as a liability and the balance is inverted if needed. You can review this by editing the account and using the \"Invert account balance\" option.\n- If you notice specific dates where the balance flips, you can later upload a corrected balance history once we've identified the pattern.\n\nLet me know if you notice any changes or if the issue persists over the next few days. If the problem continues, I can escalate this to our data provider for deeper investigation.\n\nPlease let me know if you need anything else. \n\nWarm Regards,\nMariposa","categories":["Transactions"],"escalation":false,"reasoning":"The user is reporting an issue with their Lakeview Loan (subserviced by Mr. Cooper) mortgage account in Monarch, where the balance alternates between the correct negative value and $0 on a daily basis.

I understand how frustrating it must be to see your Lakeview Loan balance switch between the correct amount and $0 every other day, especially since you've been manually adjusting the history to keep things accurate.\n\nHere are a few steps you can try to help stabilize your account balance:\n\n- Try a force refresh: Go to your [Accounts page](https://app.monarchmoney.com/accounts?chartType=performance&dateRange=1M&timeframe=month) and click \"Refresh all\" at the top. This can help pull in the most recent and accurate data from your bank.\n- Update your login credentials: Visit your [Institutions settings](https://app.monarchmoney.com/settings/institutions), find the account, and use the three dots to update your login info. This can sometimes resolve sync issues.\n- If the problem continues, consider re-adding the account using the \"Add Account\" flow and then merging the two accounts. This can sometimes reset the connection and fix persistent issues.\n- As a last resort, if the sync remains unreliable, you might want to switch to a [manual account](https://help.monarchmoney.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058187072-Manual-accounts) for your mortgage. This allows you to update the balance as needed without relying on the automatic sync, which can be especially helpful for loan accounts that don't update reliably.\n\nLet me know if you try these steps and the issue continues, or if you need more detailed guidance on any of them. I'm here to help make this as smooth as possible for you.\n\nPlease let me know if you need anything else. \n\nWarm Regards, \nMariposa","categories":["Connection Issue"],"escalation":false,"reasoning":"The user is reporting that their Lakeview Loan Subserviced by Mr. Cooper account alternates between showing the correct balance and a $0 balance, requiring frequent manual adjustments. This is a sync and balance accuracy issue, which falls under 'Connection Issue.'

It also notes that sometimes banks provide incorrect or fluctuating data, especially with loans. Since the user has already been manually adjusting the history and is finding it frustrating, it's important to acknowledge their effort and provide clear next steps, such as trying a force refresh, updating login info, or considering a manual account if the issue persists.

The user's request is clear and urgent, and falls under the Billing category.","feedbackType":null,"expectingUserFollowup":false,"createdAt":1758823622046,"basedOn":[{"id":["4e920bc3c914c07b9a1ecacd18c7e0b3","21aa9a2ecb286ff64925fc345f73a3ac"],"title":"Can I freeze my account instead of canceling it and getting a refund?","sourceId":"https://app.usefini.com/dashboard/knowledge-items/edit?id=10925867-a7cd-489d-bc36-7f4c35a3f52c","sourceType":"fini_internal_knowledge"},{"id":"2508d529cd0a779c2e66f1242ebeda6b","title":"please cancel my account","sourceId":"https://app.usefini.com/dashboard/knowledge-items/edit?id=9390ba1b-bff1-43a8-9c15-d796f9e3ccf8","sourceType":"fini_internal_knowledge"},{"id":"3a7d0f50704426ba012de66b53142b49","title":"I want to close my account and get a refund","sourceId":"https://app.usefini.com/dashboard/knowledge-items/edit?id=ca00695a-9d6e-48a6-be85-c2a097b0d4ca","sourceType":"fini_internal_knowledge"},{"id":["8d01b0f81fc429d6ecf712f14674c975","1828db78aa41e8cb107631016f5f5fa5"],"title":"What should I do if I canceled my subscription but was still charged for it?","sourceId":"https://app.usefini.com/dashboard/knowledge-items/edit?id=9340cd6c-1feb-42bb-a36f-d3a1e3a57fb3","sourceType":"fini_internal_knowledge"},{"id":["890a5e016a1ef72262ad85986060ce24","d61de4eacb0575c161f5fb3e361f9cd3"],"title":"How can I request a refund if I was charged for a membership I thought I canceled during the free trial?","sourceId":"https://app.usefini.com/dashboard/knowledge-items/edit?id=d7cb74ab-6afd-4632-a9c0-4800c59b7f18","sourceType":"fini_internal_knowledge"},{"id":"bfc4baaf79ae4141c472b781273fb5f3","title":"Can I receive a refund if my account auto-renewed and I wanted to cancel it before being charged?","sourceId":"https://app.usefini.com/dashboard/knowledge-items/edit?id=9639d22b-4d64-48a5-871d-f2a54e157044","sourceType":"fini_internal_knowledge"},{"id":"2ea4bf1142a43825235da07383aa7054","title":"I was getting that error earlier when I attempted to subscribe two or three times.","sourceId":"https://app.usefini.com/dashboard/knowledge-items/edit?id=80a669d2-a6bb-4e36-8937-928d2c1abc0e","sourceType":"fini_internal_knowledge"},{"id":"c207d50e82e0ee7a3e559419fa9d45cc","title":"Canceling Your Subscription","sourceId":"https://help.monarchmoney.com/hc/en-us/articles/22342836013204-Canceling-Your-Subscription","sourceType":"zendesk","documentId":"5ad5ce36-4842-4f8b-ab96-5fa62b7f6a5c"},{"id":"3830eefa836b09b58eaae3842ad48f28","title":"Monarch FAQs","sourceId":"https://help.monarchmoney.com/hc/en-us/articles/19985735202068-Monarch-FAQs","sourceType":"zendesk","documentId":"4673253c-998b-4a82-b53d-717257dc20e8"},{"id":"8cd1ac519b9b586a3d3db5c81959b780","title":"Monarch's Money-back Guarantee","sourceId":"https://help.monarchmoney.com/hc/en-us/articles/30368325619732-Monarch-s-Money-back-Guarantee","sourceType":"zendesk","documentId":"b041d278-d15c-40c5-a286-8a7f84db8db3"},{"id":"5b4b43e51d48df8a5cef82baa5df1844","title":"Professionals Program","sourceId":"https://help.monarchmoney.com/hc/en-us/articles/11251085750292-Professionals-Program","sourceType":"zendesk","documentId":"dd05ab02-9cea-4a63-8bb6-976cd09e0985"}]}]},{"id":"f4f08607-6dd4-4d0d-b150-4143e45dac0b","externalId":"411046","source":"zendesk","channel":"email","escalation":true,"hasLinks":true,"feedbackType":null,"expectingUserFollowup":false,"userId":"4fe5f888-baa9-46c9-82f9-b3edd296ee42","url":"https://monarchmoney.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/411046","categories":["Connect with Team"],"createdAt":1758821463493,"updatedAt":1758823274458,"botRequests":[{"id":"93ffef04-5ce2-40b8-9912-42542df271cb","question":"We will be closed Thursday 09/25 & Friday 09/26 for training Thank you for your request!\n\nWe have two days full of automotive training for our staff and we will be closed. \n\nWe will re open on Monday 09/29 at 7:30am.\n\nOur sales staff is still checking emails and text messages so please feel free to email us and you could also text 910-233-7382 for a quicker response. \n\nWe appreciate you contacting us!

Therefore, escalation is appropriate to ensure Ray receives specialized assistance.","feedbackType":null,"expectingUserFollowup":false,"createdAt":1758822297175,"basedOn":[{"id":"d8681cf76232de64751c6052341d0bea","title":"I do not see any transactions after uploading","sourceId":"https://app.usefini.com/dashboard/knowledge-items/edit?id=f0c93836-6d37-4f67-9309-7aad634ba4c1","sourceType":"fini_internal_knowledge"},{"id":"7ec733e2b3a3aba805dd67ddef5f3a06","title":"PNC sync issues","sourceId":"https://app.usefini.com/dashboard/knowledge-items/edit?id=41ed43a9-c9a9-4ccc-84bf-16fae57ee275","sourceType":"fini_internal_knowledge"},{"id":"5079b7f005a0862f4f91710e04213f63","title":"Using the Monarch Retail Sync Extension","sourceId":"https://help.monarchmoney.com/hc/en-us/articles/36463599367188-Using-the-Monarch-Retail-Sync-Extension","sourceType":"zendesk","documentId":"14ac78d7-acd8-49ca-baf2-6edfbc1ca391"},{"id":"0bd043a5e00bce024bb3155923ddcb49","title":"FAQ: Login Security & Issues – Help | Monarch Money","sourceId":"https://help.monarchmoney.com/hc/en-us/articles/35673146932628-FAQ-Login-Security-Issues","sourceType":"web","documentId":"9b9e9ec0-8c74-42cc-8b1d-fedca2558e3b"}]}]},{"id":"d6232514-d140-41d1-b2ff-068739bce359","externalId":"406464","source":"zendesk","channel":"email","escalation":false,"hasLinks":true,"feedbackType":null,"expectingUserFollowup":false,"userId":"4fe5f888-baa9-46c9-82f9-b3edd296ee42","url":"https://monarchmoney.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/406464","categories":["Transactions","Connect with Team"],"createdAt":1758169174262,"updatedAt":1758822154302,"botRequests":[{"id":"ac04c853-d0b1-4920-a3c0-57655a7b5ac6","question":"Hello,\n\n\n\nYour advice helped me come up with an acceptable work around.

The other day I noticed they had not been synching properly. After unsuccessfully attempting to reconnect them I went ahead and deleted and readded them. Perhaps that confused the software and rather than recognizing that they are the same accounts as before they treat them as new assets and cause the net worth graph to artificially spike.\n\n\n\nThe net worth graph is the most used feature for me but will be useless without a solution to this problem.

This can happen when the system doesn't recognize the accounts as the same, impacting your historical data.\n\nYou can manually correct your net worth graph by uploading your account balance history. Here’s how you can do it:\n- Download your current balance history from Monarch.\n- Edit the file to reflect the correct balances for your Ameritas 401k accounts, ensuring that liabilities are marked as negative if applicable.\n- Re-upload the updated file to Monarch, which should update your net worth graph to display accurate data.\n\nIf you need step-by-step instructions, you can find more details here: [Import transaction data manually from banks or other finance apps](https://help.monarchmoney.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409682789908)\n\nPlease let me know if you need anything else. \n\nWarm Regards, \nMariposa","categories":["Transactions"],"escalation":false,"reasoning":"Kory has identified that the spike in the net worth graph is likely due to deleting and re-adding Ameritas 401k accounts, which may have caused Monarch to treat these as new assets, artificially inflating the graph.

Learn more about [choosing your data provider](https://help.monarchmoney.com/hc/en-us/articles/14973178437780-Choosing-Your-Data-Provider).\n- For your Ameriprise savings accounts showing incorrect totals, try force refreshing the account from the [Accounts page](https://app.monarchmoney.com/accounts?chartType=performance&dateRange=1M&timeframe=month) or manually editing the balance history on Monarch web. Instructions for [editing balances](https://help.monarchmoney.com/hc/en-us/articles/18201662700948-Fixing-Inverted-Balances) are available if needed.\n- If transactions are missing, wait 24-48 hours for them to sync, or manually refresh the account. If they still do not appear, you can import transactions via CSV or add a manual account for full flexibility. Details on [manual accounts](https://help.monarchmoney.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058187072-Manual-Accounts) and [importing transactions](https://help.monarchmoney.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409682789908-Import-Transaction-Data-Manually-from-Banks-or-Other-Finance-Apps) are available.\n\nSome institutions require frequent re-authentication due to their security protocols, which can cause recurring connection issues. If you continue to see problems after trying these steps, please let me know which specific accounts are affected and what errors you are seeing, and I can provide more targeted troubleshooting.\n\nPlease let me know if you need anything else. \n\nWarm Regards, \nMariposa","categories":["Connection Issue"],"escalation":false,"reasoning":"Jenbehrendt is experiencing multiple connection issues: BCU required re-adding (updating login did not work), Ulta Mastercard is not connecting, and Ameriprise savings accounts are not displaying correct totals. She has also expressed frustration about recurring problems with account connections, missing transactions, and incorrect balances, especially as a paying subscriber. The knowledge base provides troubleshooting steps for these scenarios, including switching data providers, updating login settings, force refreshing, manually editing balances, and using manual accounts if necessary. Since Jenbehrendt has already tried updating login settings and re-adding BCU, the next steps would be to try alternate data providers for Ulta Mastercard and Ameriprise, refresh accounts, and manually edit balances if needed. I will summarize these steps and acknowledge her frustration, offering clear next actions.","feedbackType":null,"expectingUserFollowup":false,"createdAt":1758551121669,"basedOn":[{"id":"42cfd20c32a819db71e1695dbafc20b1","title":"i can not connect my bank it says login to your bank and update account","sourceId":"https://app.usefini.com/dashboard/knowledge-items/edit?id=76365c58-9837-4add-bf0f-d752584c05c2","sourceType":"fini_internal_knowledge"},{"id":"986149a52c976bafa73009209ff40360","title":"What if my bank institution is not available? \n\t\t\n","sourceId":"https://app.usefini.com/dashboard/knowledge-items/edit?id=692fc918-83c8-448d-8e52-cbf170cdc460","sourceType":"fini_internal_knowledge"},{"id":"5579dcddf2195fc3cfbfb2ec779d7aef","title":"What do I do when I can't connect to my bank? \n\t\t\n","sourceId":"https://app.usefini.com/dashboard/knowledge-items/edit?id=0c2d8694-5d45-432f-8f42-d548b317c27a","sourceType":"fini_internal_knowledge"},{"id":"cfc056f71f53fc72af960da4b64bbe98","title":"What should I do if switching data providers does not resolve the connection issue with my Macy's card?","sourceId":"https://app.usefini.com/dashboard/knowledge-items/edit?id=8c89a4be-fb06-4847-941b-4169b872216f","sourceType":"fini_internal_knowledge"},{"id":"c8217f237b1435dcfdbd8c1034b21560","title":"all of my etrade accounts show they haven't updated in 4 months.

It's great to hear you're considering Monarch Money after using Quicken and YNAB!\n\nCurrently, the best available discount is through our referral program.

You can definitely add your home's value as an asset to balance out your mortgage liability and accurately reflect your net worth in Monarch Money.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n**Option 1: Connect your home value via Zillow**\n- On desktop: Go to the [Accounts page](https://app.monarchmoney.com/accounts), click \"+ Add account,\" select \"Add assets such as property, vehicles, & crypto,\" then choose 'Zillow.' Search for your home address, select the correct option, and save.\n- On mobile: Open the Accounts tab, tap the '+' in the top right, select \"Add assets such as property, vehicles, & crypto,\" choose 'Zillow,' search your address, and tap \"Add account.\"\n- This will automatically update your home's value monthly using Zillow's Zestimate.\n\n**Option 2: Add a Manual Account for your home**\n- If you prefer, you can create a [Manual Account](https://help.monarchmoney.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058187072) for your property and enter its value. You can update this balance anytime.\n\nOnce your home is added as an asset, your net worth will reflect both the property value and the mortgage liability.\n\nPlease let me know if you need anything else. \n\nWarm Regards, \nMariposa","categories":["Investments"],"escalation":false,"reasoning":"The user wants to add their home value as an asset to offset their mortgage liability and display an accurate net worth.

This is a billing-related issue, specifically regarding subscription pricing and account charges. The knowledge provided does not include direct instructions for resolving pricing discrepancies or adjusting billed amounts, so I cannot make changes directly. Since the user's request is to adjust their balance, which involves account-level billing actions, this needs to be escalated to the appropriate team for review and resolution.","feedbackType":null,"expectingUserFollowup":false,"createdAt":1758821519246,"basedOn":[{"id":["545ac4144f4751c9cf5c58aa3348c778","0bcda8a0fcc11d5c8f2f94bbeafd779c"],"title":"What should I do if my refund request was submitted but I have not received a confirmation?","sourceId":"https://app.usefini.com/dashboard/knowledge-items/edit?id=81d40b59-464c-4675-accd-e88e958941dc","sourceType":"fini_internal_knowledge"},{"id":["2ea4bf1142a43825235da07383aa7054","296abf69d8e49919326e68f9f3bd5ac8"],"title":"I was getting that error earlier when I attempted to subscribe two or three times.","sourceId":"https://app.usefini.com/dashboard/knowledge-items/edit?id=80a669d2-a6bb-4e36-8937-928d2c1abc0e","sourceType":"fini_internal_knowledge"},{"id":"c51e8641938ae7926a1f608ed1af518a","title":"How can I resolve issues with discrepancies in my budget calculations?","sourceId":"https://app.usefini.com/dashboard/knowledge-items/edit?id=e3a572d5-52d7-4d29-ad3c-816af249b231","sourceType":"fini_internal_knowledge"},{"id":"d8681cf76232de64751c6052341d0bea","title":"I do not see any transactions after uploading","sourceId":"https://app.usefini.com/dashboard/knowledge-items/edit?id=f0c93836-6d37-4f67-9309-7aad634ba4c1","sourceType":"fini_internal_knowledge"},{"id":"5d4d0b03b9da1ff1e8c62dd86a9a27a3","title":"I have a loan account with Earnest.
