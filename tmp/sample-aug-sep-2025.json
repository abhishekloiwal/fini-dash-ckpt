To do this, go to your Institutions page, click \"Add an account,\" search for Vanguard, and select from the available providers (Plaid, Finicity, or MX).\n4. **Edit Balance History:** If your cash balance is still incorrect, you can manually update your account's balance history on the web.

You’ve pinpointed that the SWYJX Target Index Fund isn’t pulling the correct share price, leading to underreporting in your investment breakout. While Monarch pulls prices automatically for synced accounts, if the data provider isn’t supplying the correct price, you can manually add or edit holdings to reflect accurate values.\n\nHere’s what you can do:\n- You can add a manual holding to your investment account with the correct share price and quantity. This allows you to track the balance based on the latest market price you enter.\n- To do this, go to the account details page, select “Add holding,” and input the correct details for SWYJX. If you’re on mobile, tap the “...” on the top right of the investment account page and select “Add holding.”\n- If you want to track the balance manually without specifying holdings, you can set up a fully manual investment account and update the balance as needed.\n\nThis approach works for any investment vehicle where the automatic price feed isn’t accurate.

Since your Morgan Stanley connection times out after entering your username and password and never reaches the MFA step, here are a few things you can try:\n\n- Go to your Institutions settings page, find Morgan Stanley, click the \"...\" next to it, and select \"Update login settings\". This can help refresh your credentials and may resolve the timeout issue.\n- Try connecting through a different data provider if available. You can do this by starting a new \"Add Account\" flow and selecting an alternate provider.\n- If these steps don't work, you can track your Morgan Stanley account manually in Monarch. Manual accounts allow you to enter balances and transactions yourself.
